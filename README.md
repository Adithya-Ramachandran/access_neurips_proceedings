# access_neurips_proceedings
The repo was developed to web-scrape and download the conferences proceedings of Neurips 2024 for certain downstream tasks. The script also works for other NeurIPS proceedings - https://papers.nips.cc/

The inputs are the year of proceedings required, relevant paths to store the pdfs, and a associated csv file with relevant metadata. 
The url for the proceedings is updated based on the year.
